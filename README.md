# Task-Manager-firebase

App to store daily tasks with integration of firebase.

The app for now is open to everyone without any authentication. The tasks entered are stored in the realtime database by firebase. User can add task, delete task, show all tasks, delete all tasks. User can also declare a task as completed which will prevent them from updating the task further.

Go and checkout the app on the link provided.
